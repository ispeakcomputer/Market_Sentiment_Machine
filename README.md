#Twitter UFO Tracker

This program was built in order to track UFO sightings on Twitter and load them into a HTML file which refreshes every so often. It is more or less a exercise in making a simple web app without any frameworks and seeing constant streams of information from Twitter. The app rewrites the Twitter search data to the HTML file and a HTML meta tag refreshes the browser. It could use better detection using Twitters geo location information. I noticed after building the app that I did see "sightings" though I had to research myself to see if they where in the same location .

#Motivation

This app was built in pursuit of tracking communications of a businesses competitors on Twitter using different search terms. The idea is about finding dissatisfied customers and customers in the discovery phase that are calling on the competitor business using their @handle .Even those asking about another companies services publicly could be potential customers. Unlike on Twitter this feed is constant and you can do much more with the data.
